ggplotLive
==========

R Shiny app to develop ggplot2 code with live plotting, plus code and plot downloads


What's it for?
==========

Developing ggplot2 code can require a lot of trial and error when plots become complex. 
Instead of repeatedly running programs in R and checking output files, why not edit code
in a live Shiny app, updating the plot until you get what you want? Then download the code
(or copy and paste to your editor), and you're done.
